## About Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

Intimate Partner Violence is a broad term that comprises physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, or psychologicla harm by a current or former partner or spouse.
IPV can occur between hetereosexual and same-sex couples alike, and does not require sexual intimacy. IPV is not to be confused with the legal umbrella term of "family or household member"
used to prosecute domestic assault cases (see RSMo [455.010](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=455.010) below).

Starting in 2020, the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office began to identify IPV cases referred by local law enforcement agencies and flag them as such.
IPV flags can apply to both violent and non-violent crimes, such as theft and property damage, which can be committed by intimate partners against their victim(s) 
in an effort to exert power and control over, intimiate, and/or punish the victim. IPV can also include crimes that occurred because of violence within an intimate relationship.
