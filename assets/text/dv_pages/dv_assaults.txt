## About Domestic Assault

The state of Missouri recognizes *domestic assault* as a special set of criminal offenses within the state criminal charge code ([see here](https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/CJ08Client/Home/ChargeCode)).
While not all incidents of domestic violence always arise to the level of domestic assault, these legally recognized state offenses provide tools for our prosecuting attorneys to target domestic violence offenders and protect victims from further abuse.
