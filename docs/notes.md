# Notes 

## Ashley M. Al-Shawish <AAl-Shawish@jacksongov.org> email form Sept 2025:
Asks for "broad annual breakdown of DV cases / reports over the past 10 years"

## Jazzlyn email from Jan 2025: 

Are we able to compile the number of domestic violence cases we've received and charged since 1/14/25? 
And could we start tracking the data from now on? 
I'm attaching the list of injuries we sent to law enforcement agencies that would be criteria for state charges and I'm wondering if a keyword search of the items would work?

Assault - Aggrav Assault (Family-Gun)
Assault - Aggrav Assault (Family-Weapon)
Assault - Aggrav Assault (Family-Stgarm)
Assault - Aggrav Assault NonfFamily-Gun)
Assault - Aggrav Assault (Nonfamily-Weapon)
Assault - Aggrav Assault (Nonfamily-Stgarm)
Assault - Aggrav Assault - Gun
Assault - Aggrav Assault - Weapon
Assault - Aggrav Assault (Family-Stgarm)
Kidnapping and Stalking - If there are additional charges to the DV case. 

## Jazzlyn email from July 2025:
Full criteria: broken bones, stitches/staples, physical pain that is provable, strangulation, children witnessed assault or were injured,

## Jazzlyn Sept request:

Also, could we add another category for DV homicides involving a firearm if that's possible?

## Alice Kitchen <mailto:inthekitchenak@gmail.com> request:
Can you get the current and past data on femicide cases with an open Court Order of Protection ? And how many were related to a weapon?
