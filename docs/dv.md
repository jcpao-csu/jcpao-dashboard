# Domestic Violence (DV)

## Background

Despite the preliminary success of the SAVE KC program and a record decline in non-fatal shootings reported by the KCPD in 2025, violent crime remains a significant community concern, in part due to the proportion of such crime being driven by domestic violence.

To address domestic violence, Prosecuting Attorney Melesa Johnson delivered a letter to Chiefs of Police and Municipal Prosecuting Attorneys all across Jackson County, communicating for drug distribution and serious domestic violence cases to be referred to the JCPAO for prosecution:

> *I am requesting all domestic violence cases involving strangulation, stitches or staples, broken bones, weapons, or any of the other criteria in the more detailed attached list, be referred to our office for charging. We must ensure offenders receive proper conviction for serious offenses.*

As such, the Crime Strategies Unit has been tasked with the responsibility of tracking cases received, as well as the prosecutorial outcomes of such cases once they are submitted to the JCPAO.

## Challenges

Although police agencies track reported domestic violence incidents, ambiguous and oftentimes exclusive defintions and standards of what qualifies as a domestic violence incident fail to accurately capture the number of domestic violence incidents reported in a community. The JCPAO has established a defintion, as well as criteria, for incidents that would be eligible for referral for prosecution of state-level charges.

Domestic violence (DV) refers to a broad range of abusive behaviors used to assert power and control within domestic, intimate, or familial relationships. For the purposes of data analysis and keyword searching, DV includes incidents involving current or former partners, family members, or household membersâ€”regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or legal relationship status. DV incidents may be categorized by relationship type, form of abuse, and context of harm as outlined below:

1. Relationship Types

   - Use the following categories to tag and search DV-related incidents:

     - Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)

       - Current spouses or romantic partners
       - Former spouses or romantic partners (including ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, ex-husbands/wives)
       - Dating partners (regardless of cohabitation)
       - Individuals in same-sex or gender-diverse relationships
     - Familial or Intra-Family Violence

       - Parent/child (including step- and adoptive)
       - Sibling/sibling
       - Extended family (e.g., grandparents, cousins, in-laws)
       - Legal guardians or other custodial figures
     - Violence by Former Partners Toward New Partners

       - Former intimate partners targeting the current partner of their ex
       - Includes stalking, harassment, or physical violence aimed at the new partner
     - Household Violence (Non-Familial)

       - Roommates or cohabitants not in a familial or romantic relationship

3. Contextual Indicators (Use for Query Refinement):

   - Protective orders or restraining orders
   - Custody disputes involving DV allegations
   - Reports or records involving the same parties over time
   - Police reports, 911 calls, or hospital records with relationship-based identifiers
   - History of repeat incidents across different jurisdictions involving same individuals
