# Blair's Law
# Valentine's Law

## Jazzlyn request from July 2025:
I received the media request below on Valentine's Law (575.151), which increases penalties for fleeing from police during traffic stops. 
Are you guys able to see how many of these have been charged since the law went into effect on Aug. 28, 2024?
